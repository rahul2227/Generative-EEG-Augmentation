# Generative EEG Augmentation and Source Localization via GANs, VAEs, and Simulation-Based Inference

---

This repository provides implementations For Generating Robust validated EEG signals via
approaches like GANs, Variational Auto Encoders including their variants like Conditional Wasserstein GAN and Conditional VAE.
The principal aim of this project is to generate realistic and statistically valid EEG signals and pave way for research and practical applications.

## Introduction

---

This project was done for the course of Generative Neural Networks for the sciences and explores advanced generative and inference techniques for EEG data augmentation and source localization.
This project develops a framework for generating synthetic EEG using various machine learning models. The generated EEG data can be used for testing, research, and other task specific practical application as an augmentation to real-data.
